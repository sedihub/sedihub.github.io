      <description>Prelude: This is one my old posts from my old blog, Digressions.
Have you ever wondered why the sample variance of $n$ random variable has $n-1$ in the denominator instead of $n$?
$$ \sigma^2_{n} = \frac{1}{\underbrace{\mathbf{n-1}}{\text{instead of }\mathbf{n}}}\sum_{i=1}^{n} (X{i}^2 - \bar{X}), $$ where, $\bar{X}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i$ is the mean of the $n$ instances of the random variable.
The reason for the appearance of $\frac{1}{n-1}$ instead of $\frac{1}{n}$ is that the above expression for variance is not the estimated variance and is the Bessel-corrected estimated variance.</description>

      <description>I finally overcame the innate resistance we all experience when forced to change and started migrating my projects and blog posts. This will take some time as I have to also update my old projects, which I likely wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have done otherwise. Setting things up took some effort, but I&amp;rsquo;m pleased with the better organization and centralization.</description>
